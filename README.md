# 🧠 CTF Write-Ups & Offensive Security Research

> A curated collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) write-ups, lab walkthroughs, and offensive security research focused on methodology, tooling, and learning—not shortcuts.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository serves as my **CTF and lab write-up knowledge base**, documenting my approach to solving challenges across:

- Web Application Security
- Network & Infrastructure Attacks
- Active Directory Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Enumeration Methodology
- Post-Exploitation Analysis

The goal is to **demonstrate structured thinking**, repeatable processes, and clear technical communication—skills essential for real-world penetration testing and security engineering.

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Notice & Scope

All content in this repository adheres to the following principles:

- Targets are **intentionally vulnerable systems** (CTFs, labs, or authorized environments)
- No zero-day exploitation or live systems
- No credentials, tokens, or private flags are exposed
- Write-ups are shared **after challenge completion or official retirement**, where applicable

This repository is for **educational and defensive improvement purposes only**.

---

## 📝 Write-Up Format

Each write-up follows a **consistent, professional structure**:

1. **Target Overview**
2. **Attack Surface Enumeration**
3. **Vulnerability Identification**
4. **Exploitation Path**
5. **Privilege Escalation**
6. **Post-Exploitation Findings**
7. **Lessons Learned**
8. **Defensive Takeaways**

This mirrors real-world **penetration testing reporting workflows**.

## 🧰 Tooling & Techniques

Common tools and frameworks referenced:

- Nmap / Masscan
- Burp Suite
- Metasploit Framework
- BloodHound
- Impacket
- Linux & Windows privilege escalation techniques
